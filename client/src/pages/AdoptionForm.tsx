// If we have time then we should make this form a little bit more dynamic and add styling to it.
// This area should pull information from the postgres database in the use profile page and populate the form with the user's information.
// There will also be additional fields that the user will need to fill out.
// We also need to figure out where to send this information once it is submitted. Should go to an admin location for approval, maybe an admin email address.
